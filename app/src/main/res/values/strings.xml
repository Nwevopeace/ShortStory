    <string name="story">Once there was a dog who wandered the streets night and day in search of food. One day, he found a big juicy bone and he immediately grabbed it between his mouth and took it home. On his way home, he crossed a river and saw another dog who also had a bone in it\'s mouth. He wanted that bone for himself too. But as he opened his mouth, the bone he was biting fell into the river and sank. That night, he went home hungry.
        \n\n <b>Moral Lesson of the story\:</b> \nIf we always envy what others have, we\'ll end up losing what we already have, just like the greedy dog.
